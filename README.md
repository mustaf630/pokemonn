This repository contains a monorepo of the Pokedex app.

The Pokedex is an app which the user can view a list of Pokemons, search and view the details of a specific Pokemon. To get the Pokemons data it was used the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

The main goal with this project was to know and learn hot the animations and gestures work on React Native. In order to do that it was used mainly the [Animated API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated) from React Native.
